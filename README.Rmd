# Design

* Use Twitter API to search for `#Monzo` or `@Monzo` tweets.
  * Need to register Twitter Application - Done
  * Does an R Twitter library exist? - Done. Using TwitteR
  * Potentially filter these for relevant ones? Need to define what I'm looking for exactly.
    * For people who have tweet a question to Monzo, iterate through their tweets since to look for Happy or sad tweets relating to Monzo?
* Apply sentiment analysis to these tweets
  * R Sentiment anaylsis library.
  * Tidy Text Mining could be helpful here?
* Measure sentiment over a window eg Day, Week, Month.

## Thoughts

* Could be a novelty and not really give insight
* Does the sentiment of a company vary hugely? ie Does Virgin Trains have better sentiment than South West Trains?
